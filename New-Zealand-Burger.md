# The New Zealand Burger
## Where and What Was it?
If *only* I could _remember_.
### What _do_ I remember?

* Beets were involved.
* We were definitely in New Zealand.
* On a small island - Waiheke Island.
* The burger was enormous.
* The restaurant had a view.
* The restaurant was on the main drag.

End of list. 

A quick Google of _"best burgers in Waiheke Island"_ gives us a few choices, but the one that stands out the most is _The Local_. Their website also mentions having a cheeseburger with __BEETROOT__. *Ding ding ding*! We have a **winner**!
